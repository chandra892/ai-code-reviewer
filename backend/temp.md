Okay, I'm on it. Here's my code review of the provided JavaScript function, keeping in mind my role as a senior code reviewer with 7+ years of experience:

**Code:**

```javascript
function add(a, b){return a + b; }
```

**Review:**

**Overall Impression:**

The code is very simple and straightforward. It performs basic addition.  For such a small function, the main concern is readability and potential edge cases, even if unlikely.

**Points of Consideration:**

*   **Brevity vs. Readability:**  While concise, the lack of spacing could be slightly improved for readability.
*   **Type Handling:** JavaScript is dynamically typed.  Consider what happens if `a` or `b` are not numbers.
*   **Naming:** The name `add` is perfectly acceptable for a basic addition function.
*   **Error Handling/Edge Cases:** Not really applicable for such a simple addition function unless you have very specific requirements (e.g., dealing with very large numbers and potential overflow).

**Recommendations:**

1.  **Improve Spacing (Minor):**  Add a little spacing to improve readability, even if it's just a personal preference.       

2.  **Consider Type Checking (Optional, but Recommended for Robustness):** While not strictly *necessary* for such a simple function, especially if it's only used internally within your codebase where you control the inputs, adding a quick type check can improve robustness and prevent unexpected behavior if the inputs are ever something other than numbers.

**Revised Code (with Spacing and Type Checking):**

```javascript
function add(a, b) {
  if (typeof a !== 'number' || typeof b !== 'number') {
    return NaN; // Or throw an error, depending on your needs
  }
  return a + b;
}
```

**Explanation of Changes:**

*   **Spacing:** Added spaces around operators and after commas.  This is primarily a stylistic improvement.

*   **Type Checking:**  Added a check using `typeof` to ensure that `a` and `b` are both numbers. If either is not a number, it returns `NaN` (Not a Number).  You could choose to throw an error instead, depending on how you want to handle invalid input. Returning `NaN` is generally a more graceful approach in JavaScript.  The key here is to *explicitly* handle the case where the inputs might not be what you expect.

**Alternatives for Type Checking (if you use a transpiler like Babel or TypeScript):**

*   **TypeScript:** If you're using TypeScript, you can strongly type the function parameters:

    ```typescript
    function add(a: number, b: number): number {
      return a + b;
    }
    ```

    TypeScript will enforce that `a` and `b` are numbers at compile time, preventing type errors from ever reaching runtime.  

*   **Babel with PropTypes:** If you're using Babel, you can use PropTypes (common in React) for runtime type checking (though primarily used for component props, it can be adapted).

**Summary:**

The original code is functional but could be slightly improved. The suggested changes (especially the type checking) make the function more robust and easier to understand.  The level of robustness you need depends on the context in which the function is used.  If it's a simple, internal function, the original might be perfectly acceptable.  If it's part of a public API, the more robust version is highly recommended.
